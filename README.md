# Oxid Coding Challenge

## 1. CURRENCY CONVERTER

You need to design a simple converter which accepts a monetary value in a certain currency as an argument and outputs
list of results converted to various world currencies (requested currencies and exchange rates will come from a data
source).

Data source for currencies and exchange rates (for now data is in JSON, but you've already heard that soon you'll need
to switch to CSV or XML so make the switch as easy as possible):

```json
{
  "baseCurrency": "EUR",
  "exchangeRates": {
    "EUR": 1,
    "USD": 5,
    "CHF": 0.97,
    "CNY": 2.3
  }
}
```

The output (list of results) should be in JSON or CVS format (might change in the future). Possible interface for the
converter, itâ€™s just an example, feel free to improve, modify it or define your own:

```php
interface CurrencyConverterInterface
{ 
    public function convert(float $amount, Currency $currency): string;
}
```

### Installation & Setup
```console
composer install
```
### Execution

```console
php index.php
```
### Running Tests

```console
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/ --colors
```

GitHub Workflow is also added for phpunit, [view here](https://github.com/mubasharkk/oxid/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml]).
